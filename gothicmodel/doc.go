// Package gothicmodel represents a model in simple but generic terms. A model
// has a name and a list of fields, the first of which is the primary field.
// A field is just a mapping of a name to a type, both of which are strings. The
// name is unique within the model. The type string can be used in each code
// generation context.
package gothicmodel
