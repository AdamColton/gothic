## Dev Notes

### Todo

* set order on methods

#### Comments
Add a comments utility to take a comment string, wrap it at a given col width (
80 by default) and prepend // to each line. Functions, Structs and Types should
all have a way to attach a comment. A file should also be able to have a package
comment. And it would be nice to be able to generate a doc.go file from a
comment on a package.
